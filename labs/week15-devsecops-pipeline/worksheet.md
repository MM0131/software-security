# Worksheet 15 — DevSecOps: Putting It Together (4 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · Week 15
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 **A09 Security Logging & Alerting Failures** · **A10 Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions** (scanners also cover A02/A03) · **CWE-636** (fail open), CWE-532 (logging sensitive data), CWE-209, CWE-489, CWE-798
> **Signature game:** 🔴🔵 *Break the Build* (Red vs Blue) — Blue scores per catch, Red scores per bypass.

> ⚠️ **Ethics note:** The pipeline and `sample-service.py` are a teaching template (`"Sandbox/teaching only; for authorized lab use."`). Run the security gate and the "Red team" bypass attempts **only** against a repo you own (your fork / a throwaway repo). Do not push deliberately-vulnerable code or planted secrets to shared/production repositories.

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions

Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).

1. `README-pipeline.md` says each tool runs **twice** (report step, then gate step). Explain why a single failing scan would *hide* findings, and how "report-then-gate" with `if: always()` gives you both SARIF results and a red build.
2. What is the difference between **fail-closed** and **fail-open**? In `sample-service.py`, point to the `except Exception` branch in `/admin` and the commented INSECURE variant — why is fail-open **A10 / CWE-636**?
3. The `permissions:` block in `security-ci.yml` is `contents: read`, `security-events: write`. Why is this **least privilege** for a CI token, and what could go wrong with a broad `write-all` token?
4. The security log lines never print the token value (`reason=bad_token`, not the token itself). Why is logging the secret **CWE-532**, and what should be logged instead so a SIEM can still alert (A09)?
5. Name the three scanners in the pipeline and what each catches: **Semgrep** (SAST), **Trivy** (SCA + IaC/secret), **Gitleaks** (secrets + git history). Which OWASP categories does each map to per the README table?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (180 min in class)

> The task budgets below add up to 205 min. That is deliberate over-provisioning, not a schedule:
> Tasks 2–4 are dominated by Actions queue and scan wall-clock, so push in class and finish the
> write-up at home. Your instructor will say which task runs as homework.

![Two panels: the CI gate in security-ci.yml, where a MEDIUM DS-0001 finding slips past the HIGH,CRITICAL threshold and the build goes green, and the /admin handler, where one except branch returns 200 with the flag while the other returns 403 and logs it.](img/fail-closed.svg)

**Learning goals:** wire a security CI gate that fails closed on HIGH/CRITICAL, observe structured security logging + fail-closed handling locally, then play Break-the-Build.

**Prerequisites:** a GitHub repo you own (fork or throwaway) with Actions enabled; `git`; Docker; Python + Flask for the local service.

### Environment setup (real commands)

```bash
# --- A) Wire the gate into a repo you own (README-pipeline.md §1) ---
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp labs/week15-devsecops-pipeline/security-ci.yml .github/workflows/security-ci.yml
git add .github/workflows/security-ci.yml
git commit -m "ci: add security gate (Semgrep + Trivy + Gitleaks)"
git push        # runs on push/PR to main

# --- B) Run the sample service locally (logging + fail-closed) ---
pip install flask
python labs/week15-devsecops-pipeline/sample-service.py
# In another shell:
curl -s -X POST localhost:5001/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"token":"nope"}'   # 401 authn_failure
curl -s localhost:5001/admin -H 'Authorization: bob-token'    # 403 authz_failure
curl -s localhost:5001/admin -H 'Authorization: alice-token'  # 200 (admin)
```

**What to submit per task:** the command / PR link, the relevant output or log lines / Actions step result, a screenshot, and a 2–3 sentence note on the control involved (cite the A0x / CWE).

### Tasks

- **Task 0 — Onboarding (15 min).** Run the sample service; trigger the three curls above. **Deliverable:** screenshot of the structured `event=...` security log lines for authn_failure, authz_failure, and authz_success.
Ans = Ran `python labs/week15-devsecops-pipeline/sample-service.py` to start the sample
service on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`, then triggered the three curl requests:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:5001/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"token":"nope"}'
# -> {"error":"authentication failed"}

curl -s localhost:5001/admin -H 'Authorization: bob-token'
# -> {"error":"forbidden"}

curl -s localhost:5001/admin -H 'Authorization: alice-token'
# -> {"secret":"the cake is a lie"}
```

Structured security log lines produced by the server:

- **Task 1 — Logging & fail-closed (35 min, A09/A10).** *Goal:* prove fail-closed behavior. *Steps:* read `/admin` in `sample-service.py`; explain why the broad `except Exception` returns **403, not the secret**, and why `type(exc).__name__` (not the message) is logged (CWE-209). Identify the line that would make it fail *open* (the commented INSECURE variant). *Deliverable:* the log lines + a 2–3 sentence explanation of fail-closed vs fail-open.
Ans = The two log lines show that the system denied Bob's access because he was not an admin, while Alice was allowed to access the admin page.

The code uses `except Exception` to catch unexpected errors and return a 403 response, which is called fail-closed because access is denied when an error occurs. It also logs only the exception type instead of the full error message to prevent sensitive information from being exposed (CWE-209).

If the code used the insecure version that returns the secret inside the exception handler, it would become fail-open and could expose sensitive information when an error occurs.

- **Task 1b — Break the Build, live (25 min, A10 / CWE-636).** *Goal:* exploit a real fail-open, then prove the fix. *Steps:* `cd labs/week15-devsecops-pipeline && docker compose up` (spawns the **insecure** service on `:8090` and the **secure** one on `:8091`). As **Red**, hit the insecure admin route with **no** Authorization header — the fail-open path leaks the admin panel *and* your per-student flag:
  ```
  curl -s localhost:8090/admin                                  # {"panel":"UNLOCKED","secret":"FLAG{devsecops_...}"}  <- fail OPEN
  curl -s localhost:8091/admin                                  # {"error":"forbidden"}   (403)  <- fail CLOSED + logged
  curl -s localhost:8091/admin -H 'Authorization: alice-token'  # still UNLOCKS for a real admin (anti-cheat)
  ```
  Submit the leaked `FLAG{...}`. *Deliverable:* the flag, the two contrasting `/admin` responses (`:8090` leak vs `:8091` deny), and the exact line in `insecure_service.py` that fails open. *(The instructor auto-grader re-runs these exploits against your hardened box — you pass only if every bypass is blocked **and** a valid admin token still works.)*
  Ans =

- **Task 2 — Stand up the gate (35 min).** *Goal:* get the workflow running. *Steps:* push `security-ci.yml`, open the Actions run, confirm the three jobs (`semgrep`, `trivy`, `gitleaks`) execute and SARIF appears in the Security tab. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the Actions run + the Code scanning alerts page.
Ans = 

- **Task 3 — Blue team: pass the gate (30 min).** *Goal:* a green build. *Steps:* ensure the protected repo has no HIGH/CRITICAL findings and no secrets; fix or justify-and-document any (no blanket-ignore, per README §4). *Deliverable:* link to the passing run.

- **Task 4 — Red team: Break the Build (40 min).** *Goal:* make the gate say **no**. *Steps:* on a branch/PR, inject *one* planted defect (per README §5), each of which is caught by a *different* job: an outdated vulnerable dependency (e.g. an old `urllib3`) → Trivy SCA; a Dockerfile that runs as **root** — drop the `USER` line, or write `USER root` → Trivy config (`DS-0002`, HIGH); or a hard-coded token → Gitleaks. Open the PR and watch the matching gate step fail. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the **failing** gate step + which job caught it (Trivy SCA / Trivy config / Gitleaks) and which `exit-code: "1"` / `--error` step enforced it.
  > **Why root and not `chmod 777`.** Both gate steps filter to `--severity HIGH,CRITICAL`, and Trivy's Dockerfile scanner has no rule for `chmod` at all — it checks instruction-level `RUN`/`COPY` semantics, exactly as Week 13 Task 1 says. `chmod 777` therefore returns **nothing**, at any severity, and the build goes green: a defect that slips the gate is a Task 5 *Red point*, not a Task 4 screenshot. `:latest` is no good either — that is `DS-0001` and Trivy rates it MEDIUM, which this gate filters out. Running as root is `DS-0002` HIGH, so it fails the build for real.

- **Task 5 — Score Break-the-Build (25 min).** *Goal:* tally Red vs Blue. *Steps:* one Blue point per finding the gate caught, one Red point per finding that slipped through; for any bypass, propose the rule that would have caught it. *Deliverable:* scoreboard + one proposed gate improvement.

## Part 4 — Reflection

1. **Mapping.** For three controls you exercised, give: control → A09/A10 (or A02/A03 for a scanner) → CWE → one-line rationale.
2. **Real incident.** Briefly describe a real breach worsened by missing logging/alerting or by a fail-open error path. Which control here would have changed the outcome?
3. **Best mitigation.** Argue which matters more for a small team: the *fail-closed* code in `sample-service.py`, or the *CI gate* in `security-ci.yml` — and why both together beat either alone.

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show a terminal running `printf '%s | %s | ' "$(whoami)" '<YOUR-STUDENT-ID>'; date '+%F %T %Z'` **in the
  same image as the evidence**. When the evidence is a browser page, a DevTools panel or a
  rendered response, put that terminal **beside the browser and capture the whole screen** — a
  cropped window carries nothing that identifies you, and the lab's own output is
  byte-identical for the whole cohort *by design*, so the stamp is the only thing that makes
  the shot yours. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. How to submit: **learn.zcr.ai/submit** (full guide: `SUBMISSION.md` in the repo root).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

---

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.

---

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** In 2–3 sentences, in your own words, describe what this week's vulnerable code/endpoint actually *does* and *why it is exploitable* — explain the mechanism, don't dump jargon.

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that makes an AI produce a *correct, secure* fix for one finding. Run it: does the exploit now fail? If not, refine the prompt and try again. Submit the **final prompt + the verified result**.
*Graded on the prompt's precision and your verification — this trains problem decomposition and AI literacy (Denny et al. 2024).*
